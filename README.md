Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the landscape of artificial intelligence, driving breakthroughs in natural language processing, reasoning, and a wide range of downstream applications. The unprecedented pace of research in this area has led to an explosion of literature, with new papers and comprehensive surveys published almost every week. 

This repository provides a curated and up-to-date collection of survey papers covering all major aspects of LLMs. The aim is to help researchers, practitioners, and newcomers quickly navigate the vast and fast-evolving body of work in this field. The surveys are organized by topic-including model architectures, alignment, prompt learning, evaluation, societal impact, efficiency, multimodal models, applications, and more-making it easy to find in-depth overviews on any subdomain of interest.

Whether you are seeking foundational knowledge, tracking the latest trends, or exploring specialized applications of LLMs, this resource is intended to serve as a comprehensive starting point for your research and development efforts.

*Contributions and suggestions for additional surveys are welcome!*
